A set of reduced models of layer 5 pyramidal neurons from: **Automated optimization of a reduced layer 5 pyramidal cell model based on experimental data** [Bahl et al. 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016502701200129X) 

## Original NEURON version

The original code for this model was obtained from ModelDB ([146026](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/showModel?model=146026)) and can be found [here](NEURON).

## Conversion to NeuroML

The conversion to NeuroML of this model can be found [here](NeuroML2).

See also https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/Contribute/issues/15 for issue related to this.

Much of the work to convert this model to NeuroML wascarried out by [Shayan Shafquat](https://github.com/shayan823) as part of Google Summer of Code 2023.
