# Conversion to NeuroML

To run this code:
```
nrnivmodl ../NEURON/channels/
python export_nml2.py

```
# After conversion to NeuroML

### Optimization of the dendritic calcium dynamics and somato-dendritic coupling for varying current injections into the soma and the dendrite
#### (b) A small EPSP shaped dendritic current injection does not lead to spiking

#### (c) A somatic current pulse elicits a single somatic spike that back-propagates into the dendrite without crossing the threshold for the initiation of dendritic calcium APs

#### (d) A small dendritic current injection is added the threshold can be crossed and dendritic calcium spikes are elicited and eventually somatic bursting

#### (e) A calcium spike can also be initiated locally in the dendrite when a strong dendritic current injection is used
